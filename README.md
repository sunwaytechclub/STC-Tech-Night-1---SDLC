## Software Development Life Cycle <a name="sdlc"/>
	
* A framework that defines a sequence of steps in the software development process
* Serves as a guidance for Software Developers
* Involves 6 steps in total
  * Planning
    * Allocation of resources
    * Project scheduling
    * Cost estimation
  * Defining Requirements
    * Requirements analysis
    * System requirements
    * Client requirements
  * Designing
    * Software architecture
    * User interface
  * Software Development
    * Coding
    * Development
    * Methodologies
  * Testing/Prototyping
    * Code quality
    * Performance
    * Security
  * Deployment & Maintenance
    * Pushed to market
    * Services for end-users

## Waterfall Model <a name="waterfall"/>
![waterfall model](/assets/waterfallmodel.png)
The Waterfall Model is the Oldest Software Development Model. It is also referred to as a linear-sequential life cycle model. In a waterfall model, each phase must be completed before the next phase can begin and no backtracking in the phases.

### 5 steps in total
* Requirements definition
* System and software design
* Implementation and unit testing
* Integration and system testing
* Operation and maintenance
* [More information](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sdlc/sdlc_waterfall_model.htm)

### Application
* When requirements are very well documented
* The project is short
  * Assignments are typically the perfect target to implement  the Waterfall model because
      * Short-termed (2 weeks - 1 month)
      * Fixed system requirements prepared by lecturer
      * Documentation are well-written
      * Organised operation
      * Rare cases of changes

### Disadvantages
* Unsuited in real-life projects like freelance or company projects
* Hard to accomdate to changing requirements which leads to 
  * Exceeding planned cost
  * Project failure
  * Slower development
* Not usable and no review on software until the end of process
* Not practical to use in the current developing industry
